#### Testing The Chrome Extension

After you've clone or downloaded this repo, you have to go to `chrome://extensions/.`
There is a button that says Load Unpacked, pick the TLDR folder inside this repo and then it'll automatically be in your extension(make sure you are in developer mode).

If you make changes in the html or js you'll have to click reload every single time.

Happy Hacking!
